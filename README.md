# Combinatorics

## Motivation

Combinatorics, in particular Combinations and Permutations, were the weakest point
for me when taking my discrete mathematics course. In an effort to automate the process
and actually understand the math behind them, I wrote these scripts.

## Prerequisites

Have Python3.0 or higher to run

## Program Execution

The options are:

- `combinations.py`
- `permutations.py`

```sh
python3 <scriptname>.py
```

## Project Reflection

These scripts were fun to write and helped reinforce the math behind permutations
and was neat making a brute force algorithm for all possible combinations. At a
later date, I might fix up combinations to have more valuable information for
the user.
