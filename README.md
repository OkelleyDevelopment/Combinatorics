# Combinatorics

## Motivation

Combinatorics, in particular Combinations and Permutations, were the weakest point
for me when taking my discrete mathematics course. I wrote these scripts in an effort to automate the process
and improve my current understanding..

## Prerequisites

* Python3.0 or higher

## Program Execution

The options are:

- `combinations.py`
- `permutations.py`

```sh
python3 <scriptname>.py
```

## Project Reflection

These scripts were fun to write and helped reinforce the math behind permutations
and was neat making a brute force algorithm for all possible combinations. At a
later date, I might fix up combinations to have more valuable information for
the user.
